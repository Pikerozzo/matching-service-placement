# Virtual Resource Allocation in MEC Using Matching Algorithms

This project explores how different matching algorithms affect virtual resource allocation in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environments, focusing on energy efficiency and resource utilization.

## Algorithms Compared
- Random
- Greedy (First Fit)
- Round-Robin
- Gale-Shapley (dynamic preferences)
- Auction-based

## Key Features and Analyses
- VM-to-PM assignment
- Load balancing and task consolidation
- Evaluation of energy and resource efficiency

## Project Structure
- matching-service-placement/src/main/java/: Code and algorithm implementations
- docs/: Reference article and final project report
